# Benchmarks
This directory contains the lightly modified benchmark downloads from http://www.tpc.org.  The intent is to have tool kits that are 100% compatible with Splice Machine while remaining true to form for TPC benchmarks.  

## TPC-C
[TPC-C](http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/default.asp) is an OLTP or trnasactional benchmark Splice Machine currently uses a project derived from (a very old version of) [oltpbenchmark](https://github.com/oltpbenchmark/oltpbench).  This work will be made publicly available soon. 

## TPC-H
[TPC-H](http://www.tpc.org/tpch/default.asp) a slightly older OLAP benchmark. The tools here have only been slightly modified and the query templates do not generate splice compatible query statements yet. This will be revisited soon.  

## TPC-DS
[TPC-DS](http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/default.asp) the latest OLAP type benchmark from the TPC.  The code and templates here have been modified to work with Splice Machine.  The commit hsitory in the project serves as a guide to see the necessary modifications.  The intent is to only modify what is necessary to get past syntax/parser differences, and not impact the auditability of the queries/benchmark run generated by this tool.
